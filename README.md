Building production-like systems through a hands-on homelab 

I help teams **simplify complex systems** and **improve development efficiency**.  

This GitHub documents how I **design, operate, and experiment** with infrastructure.  
I focus on **decisions, trade-offs, and real-world limitations** — not just the tools themselves.  

In my homelab, I simulate production-like systems to:

- Handle failures safely 🔧  
- Scale stateful workloads 📦  
- Test operational limits ⚡  
- Refine automation and observability practices 📊  

It’s where I **experiment, learn from failures**, and develop the mental models I carry into real production environments.

## 🖥 DevOps Homelab

A production-inspired homelab designed to practice:

- Kubernetes operations under failure and degradation  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)  
- Observability, monitoring, and reliability patterns  
- Network and storage constraints  
- Operational trade-offs and decision-making under real limitations

This is **not a collection of tutorials**. It’s a record of experiments, what worked, what broke, and how I’d approach production differently.

### Core Stack

- **Linux**: systemd, networking, storage  
- **Kubernetes**: multi-node, high availability experiments  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform / Ansible  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions  

### Platform Capabilities

- **Networking**: ingress, load balancing, DNS  
- **Storage**: persistent volumes, backups  
- **Observability**: metrics, logs, alerts
